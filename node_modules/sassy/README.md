# Sassy

Sassy eases the pain for object-oriented programmers and makes getting around in SASS a little easier.

###Overview

> Sassy provides some essential functionality and makes working with maps much easier.
 
> *It also includes a debugging utility for unit-testing (see notes at the bottom).*

### Method Uses: 

@note All methods that use a ( map, key, ... ) signature **allow for nested maps using a key list!**

</details>

## Sassy Debugger

I put together a SASS debug utility based loosely on my much more robust JS debugger. 

There are only 3 mixins you need (really only "test", but it's better to use all 3).

</details>

-

<details>Mixin: start
> starts a debugger

<summary>
######Signatures and Supported Types
</summary>

Signature: @include start(debug_name)

</details>

-

<details>Mixin: test
> performs a unit test and echos result

<summary>
######Signatures and Supported Types
</summary>

Signature:   
  - @include test( method_name, arguments, [expect=true] )
  - @include test( name, result, [expect=true] )

> *You should* ***always use a list of arguments*** *instead of a result boolean.*

> The result boolean option is there for edge cases where comparing the result isn't so easy. 

> If you need to pass a single list, use an argsmap 

>     ( args: ( your, list ) )

> *You can add a variation string as the 4th parameter. Useful if debugging similar signatures.*

-

Mixin: complete
> reports a summary of pass/fail

@note fire this after all of your tests. it will tell you that all tests passed or which ones failed (and why).

**That's all!** *Enjoy the software!*
